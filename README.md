# Image Classification on CIFAR-10

This project demonstrates how to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains information about the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `src/`: Contains source code for data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies.
- `main.py`: Main script to run the project.

## Requirements

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
Run the main script to train and evaluate the model:

python main.py
